<h4>
<a NAME="Introduction."></a>Introduction.</h4>
This guide is intended for anyone who is interested in improving performance
and responsiveness in their Delphi applications by using threads. It covers
a range of topics from absolute beginner to intermediate level, and some
of the real world examples raise issues bordering on the advanced. It assumes
that the reader has a reasonable knowledge of Object Pascal programming,
including simple object orientation, and a working understanding of event
based programming.
<h4>
<a NAME="Dedications."></a>Dedications.</h4>
Dedicated to three members of the Computer Science department at the University
of Cambridge: Dr Jean Bacon, Dr Simon Crosby, and Dr Arthur Norman.
<p>Many thanks to Jean as a tutor for making a complicated subject seem
simple, for providing excellent reference material, and for lifting a corner
of the veil around a hitherto mysterious subject. She also deserves thanks
as a director of studies, for explaining the Computer science timetable
to me. It took me three years to figure it out for myself!
<p>Many thanks to Simon as a tutor, for showing me that although modern
operating systems may be fiendishly complicated, the principles underlying
them are simple. He also deserves thanks for taking on a student with unconventional
ideas about final year project material, and for providing much useful
advice on my project dissertation.
<p>Arthur Norman never taught me a thing about multithreading. He did however
teach me many other things, which helped me when writing the more complicated
parts of this guide:
<ul>
<li>
There is no limit to the eccentricity of university lecturers.</li>

<li>
Although most people prefer simplicity, there is a certain perverse enjoyment
to be had doing things the complicated way, especially if you're cynical.</li>
</ul>
He also deserves a mention for some of the best quotes ever to fall from
a computer science lecturers lips:
<ul>
<li>
"There is something in the lecture course which may not have been visible
so far, which is reality ..."</li>

<li>
"The theoreticians have proven that this is unsolvable, but there's three
of us, and we're smart ..."</li>

<li>
"People who don't use computers are more sociable, reasonable, and ...
less twisted."</li>

<li>
"[If complexity theory lives up to its title] if that proves to be the
case, I will be the winner, as not many of you will attempt the exam questions."</li>
</ul>
