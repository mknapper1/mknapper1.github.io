<h4>
<a NAME="What data is shared between threads"></a>What data is shared between
threads?</h4>
First of all, it is worth know exactly what state is stored on a per process
and per thread basis. Each thread has its own program counter and processor
state. This means that threads progress independently through the code.
Each thread also has its own stack, so local variables are inherently local
to each thread, and no synchronization issues exist for these variables.
Global data in the program can be freely shared between threads, and thus
synchronization problems may exist with these variables. Of course, if
a variable is globally accessible, but only one thread uses it, then there
is no problem. The same situation holds for memory allocated on the heap
(normally objects): in principle, any thread could access a particular
object, but if the program is written so that only one thread has a pointer
to a particular object, then only one thread can access it, and no concurrency
problem exists.
<p>Delphi provides a <b>threadvar</b> keyword. This allows "global" variables
to be declared where a copy of the variable is created for each thread.
This feature is not used much because it is often more convenient to put
such variables inside a TThread class, hence creating one variable instance
for each TThread descendant created.
<h4>
<a NAME="Atomicity when accessing shared data."></a>Atomicity when accessing
shared data.</h4>
In order to understand how to make threads work together, it is necessary
to understand the concept of <b>atomicity</b>. An action or sequence of
actions is <b>atomic</b> if the action or sequence is indivisible. When
a thread performs an atomic action, it means that all other threads view
the action as either having not started, or as having completed. It is
not possible for one thread to catch another "in the act". If no synchronization
is performed between threads, then just about all operations are non-atomic.
Let's take a simple example. Consider&nbsp;<a NAME="Code4"></a><a href="#Code4" onClick="window.open('Source4.html','Code4','height=400,width=600,resizable,scrollbars')">this
fragment of code.</a> What could be simpler? Unfortunately, even this trivial
piece of code can cause problems if two separate threads use it to increment
the shared variable A. This single pascal statement breaks down into three
operations at the assembler level.
<p><tt>Read A from memory into a processor register.</tt>
<br><tt>Add 1 to processor register.</tt>
<br><tt>Write contents of processor register to A in memory.</tt>
<p>Even on a single processor machine, the execution of this code by multiple
threads may cause problems. The reason it does so is because of <b>scheduling</b>
operations. When only one processor exists, only one thread <i>actually</i>
executes at one time, but the Win32 scheduler switches between them at
about 18 times per second. The scheduler may stop one thread running and
start another thread at any time: the scheduling is pre-emptive. The operating
system does not wait for permission before suspending one thread and starting
another: the switch may happen at any time. Since the switch can occur
between any two processor instructions, it may occur at an inconvenient
point in the middle of a function, and even half way through the execution
of one particular program statement. Let's imagine that two threads are
executing the example code on a uniprocessor machine (X and Y). In a nice
case, the program may be running, and the scheduling operations may miss
this critical point, giving the expected results: A is incremented by two.

<p>In this case, A is not incremented by two but by only one. Oh dear!
If A happens to be the position of a progress bar, then perhaps this isn't
such a problem, but if it's anything more important, like a count of the
number of items in a list, then one is likely to run into problems. If
the shared variable happens to be a pointer then one can expect all sorts
of unpleasant results. This is known as a <b>race condition</b>.
<h4>
<a NAME="Additional VCL problems."></a>Additional VCL problems.</h4>
The VCL contains no protection against these conflicts. This means that
thread switches may occur when one or more threads are executing VCL code.
A lot of the VCL is sufficiently well contained that this is not a problem.
Unfortunately, components, and in particular, children of TControl contain
various mechanisms which do not take kindly to thread switches. A thread
switch at the wrong time can wreak complete havoc, corrupting reference
counts for shared handles, destroying not only data, but also links between
components.
<p>Even when threads are not executing VCL code, lack of synchronization
can still cause further problems: It is not enough to ensure that the main
VCL thread is dormant before another thread dives in and modifies something.
Some code in the VCL may execute which (for instance) pops up a dialog
box, or invokes a disk write, suspending the main thread. If another thread
modifies shared data, it may appear to the main thread that some global
data has magically changed as a result of the call to display a dialog
or write to a file. This is obviously not acceptable and means that either
only one thread can execute VCL code, or a mechanism must be found to ensure
that separate threads do not interfere with each other.
<h4>
<a NAME="Fun with multiprocessor machines."></a>Fun with multiprocessor
machines.</h4>
Luckily for the application writer, the problem is not made any more complex
for machines with more than one processor. The synchronization methods
that Delphi and Windows provide work equally well whatever the number of
processors. Implementors of the Windows operating systems have had to write
extra code to cope with multiprocessing: Windows NT 4 informs the user
at bootup whether it is using the uniprocessor or multiprocessor kernel.
However, for the application writer, this is all hidden. You do not need
to worry about how many processors the machine has any more than you have
to worry about which chipset the motherboard uses.
<h4>
<a NAME="The Delphi solution: TThread.Synchronize."></a>The Delphi solution:
TThread.Synchronize.</h4>
Delphi provides a solution which is ideal for beginners to thread writing.
It is simple and overcomes all the problems mentioned so far. TThread has
a method called <b>Synchronize</b>. This method takes as a parameter another
parameterless method which you want to be executed. You are then guaranteed
that the code in the parameterless method will be executed as a result
of the synchronize call, and will not conflict with the VCL thread. As
far as the non-VCL thread that calls synchronize is concerned, it appears
that all the code in the parameterless method happens at the moment synchronize
is called.
<p>Hmm. Sound confusing? Quite possibly. I'll illustrate this with an example.
We will modify our prime number program, so that instead of showing a message
box, it indicates whether a number is prime or not by adding some text
to a memo in the main form. First of all, we'll add a new memo (ResultsMemo)
to our main form,&nbsp;<a NAME="Code5"></a><a href="#Code5" onClick="window.open('Source5.html','Code5','height=400,width=600,resizable,scrollbars')">like
this</a>. Now we can do the real work. We add another method (UpdateResults)
to our thread which displays the results on the memo, and instead of calling
ShowMessage, we call Synchronize, passing this method as a parameter. The
declaration of the thread and the modified parts now look&nbsp;<a NAME="Code6"></a><a href="#Code6" onClick="window.open('Source6.html','Code6','height=400,width=600,resizable,scrollbars')">like
this</a>. Note that UpdateResults accesses both the main form, and a result
string. From the viewpoint of the main VCL thread, the main form appears
to be modified in response to an event. From the viewpoint of the prime
calculation thread, the result string is accessed during the call to Synchronize.
<h4>
<a NAME="How does this work What does Synchronize do"></a>How does this
work? What does Synchronize do?</h4>
Code which is invoked when synchronize is called can perform anything that
the main VCL thread might do. In addition, it can also modify data associated
with its own thread object, safe in the knowledge that the execution of
its own thread is at a particular point (the call to synchronize). What
actually happens is rather elegant, and best illustrated by another diagram.
<center><img SRC="fig4.gif" height=443 width=386></center>
When synchronize is called, the prime calculation thread is suspended.
At this point, the main VCL thread may be suspended in the idle state,
it may be suspended temporarily on I/O or other operations, or it may be
executing. If it is not suspended in a totally idle state (main application
message loop), then the prime calculation thread keeps waiting. Once the
main thread becomes idle, <i>the parameterless function passed to synchronize
executes in the context of the main VCL thread</i>. In our case, the parameterless
function is called UpdateResults, and plays around with a memo. This ensures
that no conflicts will occur with the main VCL thread, and in essence,
the processing of this code is much like the processing of any Delphi code
which occurs in response to the application being sent a message. No conflicts
occur with the thread that called synchronize because it is suspended at
a known safe point (somewhere in the code for TThread.Synchronise).
<p>Once this "processing by proxy" completes, the main VCL thread is free
to go about its normal work, and the thread that called synchronize is
resumed, and returns from the function call. Thus a call to Synchronize
appears to be another message to the main VCL thread, and a function call
to the Prime calculation thread. The threads are at known locations, and
do not execute concurrently. No race conditions occur. Problem solved.
<h4>
<a NAME="Synchronizing to non VCL threads."></a>Synchronizing to non-VCL
threads.</h4>
My previous example shows how a single thread can be made to interact with
the main VCL thread. In effect it borrows time from the main VCL thread
to do this. This doesn't work arbitrarily between threads. If you have
two non-VCL threads, X and Y, you can't call synchronize in X alone and
then modify data stored in Y. It is necessary to call synchronize from
<i>both</i>
threads when reading or writing the shared data. In effect, this means
that the data is modified by the main VCL thread, and all the other threads
synchronize to the main VCL thread every time they need to access this
data. This is workable, but inefficient, especially if the main thread
is busy: every time the two threads need to communicate, they have to wait
for a third thread to become idle. Later on, we shall see how to control
concurrency between the threads and have them communicate directly.
