<h4>
<a NAME="Why write thread safe classes"></a>Why write thread safe classes?</h4>
Simple Delphi applications written by newcomers to thread writing tend
to include their synchronization as part of the application logic.&nbsp;
As the previous chapter has demonstrated, it is incredibly easy to make
subtle errors in synchronization logic, and designing a separate synchronization
scheme for each application is a lot of work. A relatively small number
of synchronization mechanisms are used time and again: Almost all I/O bound
threads communicate data via shared buffers, and the use of lists and queues
with inbuilt synchronization in I/O situations is very common. These factors
indicate that there is much to be gained by building a library of thread
safe objects and data structures: the problems involved in thread communication
are hard, but a small number of stock solutions covers almost all cases.
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to write a thread safe class because no other
approach is permissible. Code in DLL's which accesses system unique data
must contain thread synchronization, even if the DLL contains no thread
objects. Given that most Delphi programmers will use the facilities in
the language (classes) to allow for modular development and re-use of code,
these DLL's will contain classes, and these classes must be thread safe.
Some may be fairly simple, perhaps instances of common buffer classes as
described earlier. However, it is just as likely that some of these classes
may implement resource locking or other synchronization mechanisms&nbsp;
in a totally unique way to solve a particular problem.
<h4>
<a NAME="Types of thread safe classes."></a>Types of thread safe classes.</h4>
Classes come in many different shapes and sizes, programmers with reasonable
Delphi experience will be aware that the class concept is used in many
different ways. Some classes are used primarily as data structures, others
as wrappers to simplify a complex underlying structure. Sometimes families
of co-operating classes are used to provide flexibility when achieving
an overall goal, as is well demonstrated in the Delphi streaming mechanism.
When it comes to thread safe classes, a similar diversity is present. In
some cases the classifications can get a little blurred, but nonetheless,
four distinct types of thread safe class can be discerned.
<h4>
<a NAME="Thread safe encapsulations or derivatives of"></a>Thread safe
encapsulations or derivatives of existing classes.</h4>
These are the simplest type of multithreaded class. Typically the class
being enhanced has a fairly limited functionality and is self contained.
In the simplest case, making the class thread safe may simply consist of
adding a mutex, and two extra member functions, Lock and Unlock. Alternatively,
the functions manipulating data in the class may perform the locking and
unlocking operations automatically. Which approach is used depends to a
large extent on the number of possible operations on the object, and the
likelihood that the programmer is going to use manual locking functions
to enforce atomicity of composite operations.
<h4>
<a NAME="Data flow management classes."></a>Data flow management classes.</h4>
These are a slight enhancement to the above type, and tend to consist of
buffer classes: lists, stacks and queues. In addition to maintaining atomicity,
these classes may perform automatic flow control on the threads operating
on the buffer. This often consists of suspending threads which try to read
from an empty buffer, or write to a full one. Implementing these classes
is discussed more fully in chapter 10. A range of operations may be supported
by the one class: at one end of the scale, completely non-blocking operations
will be provided, and on the other end, all operations may be blocking
if they cannot successfully complete. A middle ground is often provided
where operations are asynchronous, but provide call-back or messaging notifications
when a previously failed operation is likely to succeed.&nbsp; The Win32
sockets API is a good example of a data flow interface which implements
all of the above options as far as thread flow control is concerned.
<h4>
<a NAME="Monitors."></a>Monitors.</h4>
Monitors are a logical step onwards from data flow management classes.
They typically allow concurrent access to data which requires more complex
synchronization and locking than a simple thread safe encapsulation of
an existing Delphi class. Database engines fall into the higher end of
this category: typically a complicated locking and transaction management
scheme is provided to allow a large degree of concurrency&nbsp; when accessing
shared data, with a minimal performance loss due to thread conflicts. Database
engines are a slightly special case in that they use transaction management
to allow a fine degree of control over composite operations, and they also
provide guarantees about the persistency of operations that run to completion.
Another good example of a monitor is that of a filing system. The Win32
filing systems allow multiple threads to access multiple files which may
be opened by several different processes in several different modes at
once. A large part of a good filing system consists of handle management
and locking schemes which provide optimal performance, whilst ensuring
that atomicity and persistence of operations is preserved. In layman's
speak: "Everyone can have their fingers in the filing system, but it guarantees
that no operations will conflict, and once an operation has completed,
it is guaranteed to be persistently held on disk". In particular, the NTFS
filing system is "log based", so it is guaranteed to be consistent, even
in the event of a power failure or operating system crash.
<h4>
<a NAME="Interlock classes."></a>Interlock classes.</h4>
Interlock classes are unique in this classification, because they do not
contain any data. Some locking mechanisms are useful in that the code that
comprises the locking system can be easily separated from the code that
manipulates shared data. The best example of this is the Delphi "Multiple
reader single writer interlock" class, which enables shared read and atomic
write operations on a resource. The operation of this will be examined
below, and the internal workings of the class will be examined in a later
chapter.
<h4>
<a NAME="Thread support in the VCL."></a>Thread support in the VCL.</h4>
In Delphi 2, no classes were provided to assist the multi-threaded programmer,
all synchronization was done on a strictly "roll your own" basis. Since
then, the state of the VCL has improved in this respect. I will discuss
those classes found in Delphi 4, since that happens to be the version available
to me. Delphi 3 and 2 users may find that some of these classes are not
present, and Delphi 5(+) users may find various extensions to these classes.
In this chapter I present a brief introduction to these classes and their
usage. Note that on the whole, many of the inbuilt Delphi classes are not
terribly useful: they offer very little added value over the mechanisms
available in the Win32 API.
<h4>
<a NAME="TThreadList"></a>TThreadList</h4>
As has been mentioned before, lists, stacks and queues are very common
when implementing communication between threads. The TThreadList class
performs the most basic sort of synchronization required between threads.
In addition to all the methods presented in TList, two extra methods are
provided: Lock and Unlock. The usage of these should be fairly obvious
to readers who have managed to work through the previous couple of chapters:
The list is locked before being manipulated, and unlocked afterwards. If
a thread performs multiple operations on the list that are required to
be atomic, then the list must remain locked. The list does not perform
any implicit synchronization on objects which are owned by a particular
list. The programmer may wish to devise extra locking mechanisms to provide
this ability, or alternatively, use the lock on the list to cover all operations
on data structures owned by the list.
<h4>
<a NAME="TSychroObject"></a>TSychroObject</h4>
This class provides a couple of virtual methods, Acquire and Release which
are used in all the basic Delphi synchronization classes, given the underlying
reality that most simple synchronization objects have a concept of ownership
as previously discussed. The critical section and event classes are derived
from this class.
<h4>
<a NAME="TCriticalSection"></a>TCriticalSection</h4>
This class needs no detailed explanation. I suspect its inclusion in Delphi
is simply for the use of those Delphi programmers with a phobia of the
Win32 API. It is worth noting that it provides four methods: Acquire, Release,
Enter and Leave. The latter two do nothing but call the former two, just
in case an application programmer prefers one set of nomenclature over
another.
<h4>
<a NAME="TEvent and TSimpleEvent"></a>TEvent and TSimpleEvent</h4>
Events are a slightly different way of looking at synchronization. Instead
of enforcing mutual exclusion they are used to make a variable number of
threads wait upon an occurrence, and then release one or all of those threads
when that occurrence occurs. TSimpleEvent is a particular case of an event,
which specifies various defaults most likely to be used in Delphi applications.
Events are closely related to semaphores, and are discussed in a later
chapter.
<h4>
<a NAME="TMultiReadExclusiveWriteSynchroniser."></a>TMultiReadExclusiveWriteSynchroniser.</h4>
This synchronization object is useful in situations where a large number
of threads may need to read a shared resource, but that resource is written
to relatively infrequently. In these situations, it is often not necessary
to completely lock a resource. In earlier chapters I stated that any unsychronized
use of shared resources was likely to lead to thread conflicts. While this
is true, it does not necessarily follow that a complete mutual exclusion
is always required. A complete mutual exclusion insists that only one thread
is performing any operation at any one time. We can relax this if we realize
that there are two main types of thread conflict:
<ul>
<li>
Write after Read</li>

<li>
Write after Write</li>
</ul>
Write after Read conflicts occur when one thread writes to a part of a
resource after another thread has read that value, and assumed it to be
valid. This is the type of conflict illustrated in chapter three. The other
type of conflict occurs when two threads write to the shared resource,
one after the other without the later thread being aware of the earlier
write. This results in the first write being obliterated. Of course, some
operations are perfectly legal: Read after Read, and Read after Write.
These two operations occur all the time in singly threaded programs! This
seems to indicate that we can slightly relax the criteria for data consistency.
The minimum criteria in general are:
<ul>
<li>
Several threads may read at once.</li>

<li>
Only one thread can be writing at once.</li>

<li>
If a thread is writing, then no threads can be reading.</li>
</ul>
The MREW synchronizer enforces these criteria by providing four functions:
BeginRead, BeginWrite, EndRead and EndWrite. By calling these before and
after writes, the appropriate synchronization is achieved. As far as the
application programmer is concerned, he can view it as a much like a critical
section, with the exception that threads acquire it for reading or writing.
<h4>
<a NAME="Guidelines for thread safe class writers."></a>Guidelines for
thread safe class writers.</h4>
Although later chapters cover the details of thread safe class writing,
and the various benefits and pitfalls that can be made when designing thread
safe classes, it seems worthwhile to include a few simple tips which go
a long way.
<ul>
<li>
Who does the locking?</li>

<li>
Be economical when locking resources.</li>

<li>
Allow for failure.</li>
</ul>
The responsibility for locking a thread safe class can either be given
to the class writer, or the class user. If a class provides only simple
functionality, it is normally best to give this responsibility to the class
user. They are likely to use several instances of such classes, and by
giving them responsibility for locking, one ensures that unexpected deadlocks
do not occur, and one also gives them the choice concerning how much locking
is performed, in order to maximize either simplicity or efficiency. For
more complicated classes, such as monitors, it is normal for the class
(or set of classes) to assume responsibility, thus hiding the complexities
of object locking from the end user of the class.
<p>On the whole, resources should be locked as little as reasonably possible,
and resource locking should be fine grained. Although simplistic locking
schemes reduce the chances of a subtle bug being inserted into the code,
they can to a large extent negate the performance benefits of using threads
in the first place. Of course, there is nothing wrong with starting simple,
but if performance problems occur, then the locking scheme should be examined
in more detail.
<p>Nothing ever works perfectly all the time. If using Win32 API calls,
allow for failure. If you are the sort of programmer who is happy checking
myriad error codes, then this is a workable approach. Alternatively, you
may wish to write a wrapper class, which encapsulates the Win32 synchronization
object capability whilst raising exceptions when errors occur. In any case,
always think carefully about the use of <tt><b>try</b> ... <b>finally</b></tt>
blocks to ensure that in the event of failure, the synchronization objects
are left in a sensible state.
<h4>
<a NAME="Priority management."></a>Priority management.</h4>
All threads are created equal, but some are more equal than others. The
scheduler has to divide CPU time between all the threads running on the
machine at any moment. In order to do this, it needs to have some idea
about how much CPU usage each thread is likely to use, and how important
it is that a particular thread is executed when it is able to run. Most
threads behave in one of two ways: their execution time is either CPU bound
or I/O bound.
<p>CPU bound threads tend to perform long number crunching operations in
the background. They will soak up all the CPU resources available to them,
and will rarely be suspended in order to wait for I/O or communications
with other threads. Quite often, their execution time is not critical.
For example, a thread in a computer graphics program may perform a long
image manipulation operation (blurring or rotating the image), which might
take a few seconds or even minutes. On the time scale of processor cycles,
this thread never needs to be run urgently, since the user is not bothered
whether the operation takes twelve or thirteen seconds to execute, and
no other threads in the system are urgently waiting for a result from this
thread.
<p>At the other end of the time scale we have I/O bound threads. These
normally do not take up large amounts of CPU, and may consist of relatively
small amounts of processing. They are quite often suspended (blocked) on
I/O, and when they receive input, they typically run for a short time to
process that particular input, and are almost immediately suspended again
when no more input is available. An example of this is the thread that
processes mouse movement operations and updates the mouse cursor. Every
time the mouse is moved, the thread spends a very small fraction of a second
updating the cursor, and is then suspended. Threads of this sort tend to
be much more time critical: they are not run for long periods of time,
but when they are run, it is fairly critical that they are run immediately.
In most GUI systems, it is unacceptable to make the mouse cursor unresponsive,
even for fairly short periods of time, and hence the mouse update thread
is fairly time critical. WinNT users will notice that even when the computer
is working very hard on CPU intensive operations, the mouse cursor still
reacts immediately. All pre-emptive multitasking operating systems, Win32
included, provide support for these concepts by allowing the programmer
to assign "priorities" to threads. Typically, threads with higher priorities
tend to be I/O bound, and threads with lower priorities tend to be CPU
bound. The Win32 implementation of thread priorities is slightly different
from (for example) the UNIX implementation, so the details discussed here
are specific to Win32 only.
<h4>
<a NAME="What's in a priority How Win32 does it."></a>What's in a priority?
How Win32 does it.</h4>
Most operating systems assign a priority to threads to determine which
thread should receive how much CPU attention. In Win32, the actual priority
of each thread is calculated on the fly, from a number of factors, some
of which can be directly set by the programmer, and some of which can not.
These factors are the process <b>Priority Class</b>, the thread <b>Priority
Level</b>, which together are used to calculate the thread <b>Base Priority</b>,
and the <b>Priority Boost</b> in effect for that thread. The process priority
class is set on a per running process basis. For almost all Delphi applications,
this will be the normal priority class, with the exception of screen savers,
which can be set to the idle priority class. On the whole, the Delphi programmer
will not need to modify the priority class of the running process. The
priority level of each thread can then be set within the class assigned
for the process. This tends to be much more useful, and the Delphi programmer
can use the <b>SetThreadPriority</b> API call to change the priority level
of a thread. The allowed values for this call are: <tt>THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST,
THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL, THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL, THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL,
THREAD_PRIORITY_LOWEST </tt>and<tt> THREAD_PRIORITY_IDLE</tt>. Since the
actual thread base priority is calculated as a result of <i>both</i> thread
priority level <i>and</i> process priority class, threads with priority
level above normal in a process with normal priority class will have a
greater base priority than threads with above normal priority level in
a process with below normal priority class. Once the base priority for
a thread has been calculated, this level stays fixed for the duration of
the thread, or until its priority level (or the class of the owning process)
is changed. However, the <i>actual</i> priority used from one second to
the next in the scheduler varies slightly from this value, as a result
of Priority Boost.
<p>Priority Boost is a mechanism that the scheduler uses to try and take
account of the behaviour of the threads at run time. Few threads will be
totally CPU or I/O bound during their entire lifetime, and the scheduler
will boost the priority of threads that block without using an entire time
slice. In addition, threads that own window handles which are currently
foreground windows are also given a slight boost to try and improve user
responsiveness.
<h4>
<a NAME="What priority should I make my thread"></a>What priority should
I make my thread?</h4>
With a basic understanding of priorities, we can now attempt to assign
useful priority levels to the threads in our application. Bear in mind
that by default, the VCL thread executes at normal priority level. Generally,
most Delphi applications are focussed on providing as much user responsiveness
as possible, so one rarely needs to increase the priority of a thread above
normal - doing so will delay operations such as window repainting whenever
the thread is executing. Most threads that deal with I/O or data transfer
in Delphi applications can be left at normal priority, since the scheduler
will boost the thread if need be, and if the thread turns out to be a bit
of a CPU hog, then it will not be boosted, thus resulting in reasonable
speed operations in the main VCL thread. Conversely, lowering priorities
can be very useful. If you lower the priority of a thread performing CPU
intensive background processing, the machine appears to the user to be
very much more responsive than it would if that thread were left at the
normal priority. Typically, the user is then far more likely to tolerate
a slight delay in the completion of the low priority thread: they can get
on with other tasks, and the machine and application still remain as responsive
as normal.
